"This is an exercise to gauge your familiarity with coding and think through analysis implications. You'll find a prompt and two columns below: 'Coding' and 'Questions'. For the 'Coding' portion please submit the SQL query you would run to figure out the answer. The tables are spelled out in the subsequent tabs and are populated with both a definition of the table/columns and SAMPLE data. The 'Questions' portion asks you to think through the implications of a given result.

Feel free to submit in whatever format you're most comfortable with."


### **Prompt** : 
You work for J.Crew. J.Crew has just acquired Madewell and you're working with a team that is trying to understand the Madewell business and opportunities to cross-sell to loyalty members.

### My approach: 
I'm going to use pandas and pandasql to load the sample databases and ensure my queries are working. I will write the MySQL/PostgreSQL versions of the queries as commented-out code cells within [this notebook](CaitlinRuble_JCrew_AnalyticsExcercises(2).ipynb), and I will also save these to [a .sql file saved in the same repository.](Caitlin Ruble_JCrew_AnalyticsExcercises_SQL.sql) These should be considered my final answers, though the SQLite queries will show my experimentation process and the results of running these queries with the provided sample data. Please note that sqlite has some subtle syntax differences from MySQL, which I have done my best to account for without being able to test the MySQL queries against a database.
